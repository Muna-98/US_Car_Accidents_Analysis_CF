# US_Car_Accidents_Analysis_CF
A Python based project that analyses patterns of car accidents as well as the impact of weather conditions on the amount of road collisions performed as part of CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program.


## Objective
Car accidents are one of the leading causes of death in the USA. On average, there are over 6 million passenger car accidents across US states every year causing more than 38,000 deaths. Therefore, it is important to analyze the nature and determinants of traffic collisions.The objective of this project is to derive insights about the location and patterns of car accidents, analyze the impact of weather conditions on the amount of road collisions.



## Data
The main dataset for this project is open source and was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents).


## Results
It was determined that the highest number of accidents occur during October-December, however there wasn't enough statistical evidence to prove that the weather has an impact on the frequency of car accidents.


## Deliverable
Visual results of this analysis are available [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/munavvar.makhkamova/viz/USCarAccidents2016-2021/Story1).
